      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
         Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been mixed with other
         ingredients and formed into the shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked. The
         final shape is either hand-formed on a baking sheet or pan-formed by
         cooking it in a loaf pan. It is usually made from ground beef, although
         lamb, pork, veal, venison, and poultry or a combination are also used.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>cooking spray</li>
         <li>1 1/2 pounds 80/20 ground beef</li>
         <li>1 (6 ounce) box chicken stuffing</li>
         <li>1/2 cup water</li>
         <li>1 large egg</li>
         <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
         <li>1 cup ketchup, divided</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
            C). Line an 8- x 4-inch loaf pan with a double layer of aluminum foil,
            leaving a 3-inch overhang on the long sides. Lightly coat with cooking
            spray and place on a baking sheet.
         </li>
         <li>
            Using your hands, mix beef, stuffing mix, water, egg, salt, poultry
            seasoning, and 1/2 cup of the ketchup in a large bowl until evenly
            combined without overmixing.
         </li>
         <li>Press into the prepared loaf pan on the baking sheet.</li>
         <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until top is browned and the sides are
            bubbly, about 35 minutes.
         </li>
         <li>
            While meatloaf bakes, whisk together brown sugar and remaining 1/2 cup
            ketchup in a small bowl until smooth. Remove meatloaf from the oven and
            spread ketchup mixture evenly over the top.
         </li>
         <li>
            Return to the oven and continue baking at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)
            until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest portion of
            meatloaf registers 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 10 to 15 minutes.
            Remove from oven and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
         </li>
         <li>
            Remove meatloaf from loaf pan using foil overhang as handles, and
            transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 8 slices.
         </li>
      </ol>
