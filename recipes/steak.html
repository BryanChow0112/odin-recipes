      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
         Steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It is normally grilled, though can also be pan-fried. It is often grilled in an attempt to replicate the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>1 (1 pound) rib eye steak </li>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
         <li>

         </li>
         <li>
            Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Sprinkle steak thoroughly with salt and pepper. Trim off any extra fat from steak.
